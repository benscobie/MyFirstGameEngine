# My First Game Engine

When I was in my early teens I used to really enjoy making game modes for Garry's Mod and ran a succesful community off of it. The simplicity of Lua with the hooks that Garry's Mode exposed made making something fun quite accessible. From there I went on to attempt learning C++ and writing a game using SFML, I didn't get very far but it helped spawn what is now my career as a developer.

I figured it was about time to write a "game engine" in C#, but I'm not really sure what I'm doing. All I really know is that I need a game loop. I'd like to avoid looking up existing game code and following tutorials so that I can test my knowledge of writing clean code and solving challenges that come up along the way.

I think I'll start off with something very basic rendering to a console, simple X, Y co-ordinates. Create some entities, render these, and then attempt a basic AI with some path finding. I think I'd like some trees, a couple of tree cutters and see where we go from there.

My general plan is to:

1) Create a game loop
2) Create some classes to represent a "map" and the entities I want to exist in this world
3) Render these to a console
4) Start thinking about how these are going to move around and interact with each other, and what is the best way to achieve that.
5) And so on...
